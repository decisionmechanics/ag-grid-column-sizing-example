# ag-grid Column Sizing Problem Minimal Example

The React Data Grid doesn't seem to correctly size the first column when `autoSizeAllColumns(false)` is called.

`suppressColumnVirtualisation` and `suppressRowVirtualisation` are both set to `true`.

The following packages are used:

- ag-grid-community: 28.0.2
- ag-grid-react: 28.0.0
- react: 18.2.0
