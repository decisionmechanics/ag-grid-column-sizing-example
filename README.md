# ag-grid Column Sizing Problem Minimal Example

The React Data Grid doesn't seem to size all columns correctly when `autoSizeAllColumns(true)` is called.

Columns 1970-1974 seem OK, but columns from 1975 onwards aren't sized.

The following versions of packages are used:

- ag-grid-community: 28.0.2
- ag-grid-react: 28.0.0
- react: 18.2.0
